## Abstract
Breast cancer remains a major health concern where early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. This project presents an AI-based breast cancer detection system that uses ultrasound images and a segmentation-guided deep learning framework to classify tumors as benign or malignant. By combining precise tumor localization with domain-aware diagnostic guidance, the system enhances interpretability and clinical relevance. Acting as a digital decision-support tool, the proposed approach assists clinicians and medical learners in improving diagnostic accuracy, especially in resource-limited healthcare settings.
